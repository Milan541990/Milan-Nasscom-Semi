* In this lab, I used Ansys Electronics Desktop (AEDT) to virtually design a semiconductor wire bond package from scratch. The objective was to create a complete cross-sectional model of the package till the molding/sealing stage.

* I started by defining the die and substrate geometry using AEDT’s 3D layout tools. Then, I imported the die dimensions and assigned the appropriate material properties to replicate realistic semiconductor behavior.

* Next, I created the die attach material, positioning it beneath the die to represent its adhesive layer to the substrate. Proper material properties like thermal conductivity were assigned to simulate actual packaging conditions.

* After that, I modeled the bond pads on the die and the substrate, which serve as the connection points for signal transfer.

* Using the wire bonding tool, I created gold wire bonds that connect the die pads to the substrate pads. This step is crucial for electrical connectivity in wire bond packages.

* I then added the mold compound over the entire package to encapsulate the die and wire bonds, which provides both mechanical protection and thermal insulation.

* Finally, I verified the layer stacking, geometry accuracy, and material assignments to ensure a complete and manufacturable wire bond package model.

* Each step was visualized and validated using AEDT’s 3D simulation environment, and I took screenshots at key stages to document the design progression.

* Below steps explain how to create wire bond packaging using ANSYS tool
