This repository provides an end-to-end understanding of **semiconductor packaging**, from fundamentals to advanced 3D integration and design modeling. It combines theoretical concepts, practical insights, and simulations to cover the full packaging lifecycle in modern chip design.
### Overview
Explore various types of semiconductor packages (DIP, QFN, BGA, 2.5D/3D ICs), interposers, and substrate technologies through diagrams and comparative tables. The repo also includes reliability analysis, manufacturing steps, and thermal simulation insights using ANSYS.
