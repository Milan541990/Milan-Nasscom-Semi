# Semiconductor Packaging
## Why Semiconductor Packaging Reaquired ?
 <ul>
  <li>Bare die come to foundry it’s only on wafer position so need to required protection of die or
      semiconductor devices on die(e.g corrosion, moisture and physical damage)</li>
 <li>Connection of die to other dies through packaging.</li>
 </ul>

 ## Introduction to Semiconductor Packaging
* When die comes to from foundry it’s on wafer position, so protect die or semiconductor device on die required packaging.
* In packaging system die put it on substrate with attaching glue or materials, and die connected to substrate with wire.
* This wire stich from die to substrate make wire bond and another side of substrate is connection of BGA(Ball Grade Array) which is connected to PCB or another die.

## Package and Testing Industry
* First part of semiconductor manufacturing is design where semiconductor design process done(e.g Qualcomm, Nvidia, AMD, Apple)  companies made the design.
* Second phase of semiconductor is manufacturing where the wafer manufacturing done(e.g TSMC, Global Foundries) companies made wafer semiconductor.
* Third phase of semiconductor is packaging where the packaging process done(e.g ASE, Amkor, JCET) companies made packaging of semiconductor.
* Forth phase of semiconductor is assembly after packaging of semiconductor, it’s goes to assemble on PCB.

## Product Requirement
* First we required the die which is sit on the substrate and after that it’s assemble on board
* So first thing was know about the application of semiconductor (e.g logic ,memory, power)
* After that to check how fast working with other die or connect to other die on board.
* Thermal dissipation is one of most important part in semiconductor because semi. sit on package and system and chip dissipation decided on this part.
* Form factor is decided the area of package on board how munch size required of package.
* Materials using in the package is decide to reliability or durability.
* At last cost using the semiconductor technologies minimize the cost of packaging.
