## Typical Package Structure
* There are two types of packages 1.Through hole Mounting 2.Surface mount technology
* Through hole mount technology a DIP(Dual inline pin) ,TO (Transistor Outline), PGA(Pin Grade Array) package are use where pins are directly connected to PCB hole.
* In surface mount technology a QFN(Quad flat no lead), QFP(Quad flat pin), PBGA(plastic ball grid array), LGA(lane grid array), CSP(chip scale pin), pop(package on package), MCM(multi chip module) where IC mounted on surface of PCB.

## Anatomy of Package
* In lead frame technology lead are come out of the chip and die is connected to pin through wire bond.
* In this technology IC connected to PCB through a lead.
* In laminated technology PBGA a die is connected to package or substrate and substrate to ball grade array , all this connection through a wire bond, where wire stitching form die pad to substrate  and substrate to stitch plastic ball.
* Another technology is bump or flip chip PBGA in this technology die and substrate is connected through a epoxy materials and bump is inside the epoxy which is connected between die and substrate and bump is connection to a plastic ball through the substrate.
* Where in advance package substrate two die on substrate connected through a substrate to ball grade array and BGA to substrate to connection on second die this is in 2D package system.
* In 2.1D package die is connected to the substrate RDL Layer , in this packaging system die to die connection through a RDL Layer.

## Introduction of Package Manufacturing Unit
* In package manufacturing unit have ATMP unit where a assembly, testing , marking, and packaging process done.
* ATMP unit have materials preparation and storage area, utility and maintenance room , process zone itâ€™s call clean room which is regulate the ISO class 6&7, In this area to carry out the key process like die bonding, wire and flip-chip bonding, encapsulation, RDL formation.
* And after have testing area where a electrical, burn-in, and reliability chamber test done.
* At last have a warehouse materials out for the assemble.

## Process Inside the Clean Room
* At first wafer arrived in wafer carrier and wafer goes to in inspection phase after the inspection wafer are laminated through a tape a lamination part of wafer is front side where circuit is available, because in this process we need to protect circuit area of wafer and hole the remaining process done on back side where the substrate is available.
* After the lamination process, wafer goes to griding process where the griding of wafer and cutting of silicon  process done.
* After the griding process done tape frame mounting process to wafer back side done.
* After that wafer dicing process done wafer are cutting through the blade or laser grooving.
