## Typical Package Structure
* There are two types of packages 1.Through hole Mounting 2.Surface mount technology
* Through hole mount technology a DIP(Dual inline pin) ,TO (Transistor Outline), PGA(Pin Grade Array) package are use where pins are directly connected to PCB hole.
* In surface mount technology a QFN(Quad flat no lead), QFP(Quad flat pin), PBGA(plastic ball grid array), LGA(lane grid array), CSP(chip scale pin), pop(package on package), MCM(multi chip module) where IC mounted on surface of PCB.

## Anatomy of Package
* In lead frame technology lead are come out of the chip and die is connected to pin through wire bond.
* In this technology IC connected to PCB through a lead.
* In laminated technology PBGA a die is connected to package or substrate and substrate to ball grade array , all this connection through a wire bond, where wire stitching form die pad to substrate  and substrate to stitch plastic ball.
* Another technology is bump or flip chip PBGA in this technology die and substrate is connected through a epoxy materials and bump is inside the epoxy which is connected between die and substrate and bump is connection to a plastic ball through the substrate.
* Where in advance package substrate two die on substrate connected through a substrate to ball grade array and BGA to substrate to connection on second die this is in 2D package system.
* In 2.1D package die is connected to the substrate RDL Layer , in this packaging system die to die connection through a RDL Layer.
