## Thermal simulation of Flip-Chip BGA Package.

   * In this lab, I used Ansys Electronics Desktop (AEDT) to perform a complete thermal simulation of a semiconductor package. I began by getting familiar with the AEDT interface and setting up a Flip-Chip Ball Grid Array (BGA) package model, including the die, bumps, substrate, and solder balls.

   * I carefully defined the material properties such as thermal conductivity, density, and specific heat for each component. This step was crucial for accurately modeling heat flow through the package during operation.

   * To simulate realistic conditions, I applied thermal power sources inside the die to represent heat generated during circuit operation. The setup aimed to analyze how efficiently the heat would spread and dissipate through the surrounding materials.

  
   * Once the model was complete, I created a mesh to prepare the geometry for thermal analysis. The meshing ensured accurate temperature calculations across different layers and boundaries.

   * I then ran the thermal simulation and observed the temperature distribution throughout the package. The analysis helped visualize hot spots and understand the effectiveness of the thermal path.

   * Finally, I examined and interpreted the simulation results, which allowed me to explore thermal behaviors in other package types. This hands-on experience helped me understand the role of package design and material choices in maintaining thermal reliability of semiconductor devices.
   

* Below steps explain how to set up the ANSYS tool to perform thermal simulation of Flip-Chip BGA package
